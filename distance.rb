# In the example list above, the pairs and distances would be as follows:

# The smallest number in the left list is 1, and the smallest number in the right list is 3. The distance between them is 2.
# The second-smallest number in the left list is 2, and the second-smallest number in the right list is another 3. The distance between them is 1.
# The third-smallest number in both lists is 3, so the distance between them is 0.
# The next numbers to pair up are 3 and 4, a distance of 1.
# The fifth-smallest numbers in each list are 3 and 5, a distance of 2.
# Finally, the largest number in the left list is 4, while the largest number in the right list is 9; these are a distance 5 apart.
# To find the total distance between the left list and the right list, add up the distances between all of the pairs you found. In the example above, this is 2 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 2 + 5, a total distance of 11!
